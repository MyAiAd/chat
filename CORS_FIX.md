# CORS Fix Implementation

## Problem
The application was experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to make direct API calls from the frontend to external AI services (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter).

**Error Message:**
```
Access to fetch at 'https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages' from origin 'https://chat-sagemyai.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause
External AI APIs don't allow direct calls from web browsers for security reasons. Browsers enforce CORS policies that prevent frontend JavaScript from making requests to different domains unless explicitly allowed.

## Solution
Implemented Vercel API routes (serverless functions) that act as a proxy between the frontend and external APIs:

### Architecture Flow
1. **Frontend** → Makes requests to `/api/{provider}` (same origin, no CORS)
2. **Vercel API Route** → Makes server-to-server calls to external APIs (no CORS restrictions)
3. **External API** → Returns response to Vercel API route
4. **Vercel API Route** → Returns response to frontend

### Files Created
- `api/anthropic.ts` - Anthropic API proxy
- `api/openai.ts` - OpenAI API proxy  
- `api/openrouter.ts` - OpenRouter API proxy

### Files Modified
- `src/services/aiService.ts` - Updated to use proxy endpoints instead of direct API calls
- `vercel.json` - Added API routing configuration
- `package.json` - Added `@vercel/node` dependency

### Security Features
- API keys are passed from frontend to API routes securely
- Server-side validation of requests
- Proper error handling and logging
- No API keys exposed in browser network requests

## Testing
After deployment, the application should no longer experience CORS errors when making AI API calls. All provider calls (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter) will work seamlessly through the proxy endpoints.

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates CORS errors
- ✅ Maintains security (API keys handled server-side)
- ✅ No changes required to existing UI/UX
- ✅ Works with all three AI providers
- ✅ Scales automatically with Vercel serverless functions
